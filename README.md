# Hi there, I'm Raphael Rossi 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

A full-stack developer who loves coding in terminal using nvim.

Currently working with Python and Node in an AI project at 
[`Stone`](https://github.com/stone-payments), but I also 
program in Java and Golang.

Since 2022, I've been a contributor to 
[`Thumbor`](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor), which is 
a smart imaging service currently being used by giants of the 
industry as Globo, AWS, Wikipedia and many more.

Beyond contributing to the open-source, I've also been organizing
events for the [`GolangSP`](https://www.meetup.com/golangbr/)
community, in partnership with 
[`Microsoft Reactor`](https://developer.microsoft.com/pt-br/reactor/), 
[`Stone`](https://jornada.stone.com.br/) and others.

## Find me around the web 🌎:

- Sharing my carreer on [`Linkedin`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rapha-rossi/)

Previously worked at:

Besides my professional life, I also enjoy retro gaming, magic the gathering,
home-labing, self-hosted applications and spent time with my wife and our cats.
